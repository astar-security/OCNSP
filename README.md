Open Corporate Network Securty Project (OCNSP)
----------------------------------------------
OCNSP exists because my current wiki for quickly retrieve my pentest tools usages and procedures began to look like _"the evil internal network pwning cookbook"_.  
OCNSP tries to be for corporate/private networks what OWASP is for Web Application.  

The project has two parts:
* The wiki for the testing guide
* A fork of cheat for quick reminder of the pentest useful tools

Other projects are similar and better: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Penetration_testing_methodologies  

But you know:

MY MAIN GOAL IS TO PUT ORDER IN MY METHODOLOGY BUT YOU'RE WELCOME IF YOU WANT TO CONTRIBUTE  

Basically, the testing guide is here: https://github.com/astar-security/OCNSP/wiki  
Below you will find how to use the basic cheatsheets I forked from : https://github.com/cheat/cheat and https://github.com/cheat/cheatsheets  

## Cheat
Cheatsheets are here for command line quick win in the philosophy of the original project:

To install cheat, open the cheat.sh, change the cheat path, and put cheat on your /usr/bin (yeah I know quite disgusting).  
To see what cheatsheets are available, run `cheat -l`.  
To update the cheatsheets run `cheat -u`
To see the cheatsheet of the ls command, run `cheat ls`
